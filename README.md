# EVA-Project  
In this project I worked with friends to develop a IOS app from scratch.  
  
We decide to make a news app that allowed you to choose the content of the news you would get. 
Besides that, we also created a IOT device that conected to the app and could be programed to read a random news within the content selected from time to time.
